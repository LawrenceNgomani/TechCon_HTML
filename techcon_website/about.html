        Conferences as structured gatherings trace back to ancient Greece and Rome, where large public forums and religious pilgrimages served as early models of communal discourse :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.
        By the 15th century, European trade fairs evolved into proto‐conferences focused on commerce and innovation, setting the stage for modern professional meetings :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.
        During the 19th century, industrialization spurred formal congresses like the Congress of Vienna (1815), emphasizing political and technical standardization across nations :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.
        The first conference dedicated solely to the World Wide Web, WWW1, took place at CERN from May 25–27, 1994, gathering 380 participants to discuss emerging hypertext standards; it is often called the “Woodstock of the Web” :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.
        In the 21st century, large-scale tech events such as TED and Nvidia’s GTC have expanded the boundaries of tech discourse, broadcasting ideas globally and influencing industry direction :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}.
