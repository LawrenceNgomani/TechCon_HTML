      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Conferences as structured gatherings trace back to ancient Greece and Rome, where large public forums and religious pilgrimages served as early models of communal discourse.
        By the 15th century, European trade fairs evolved into proto‐conferences focused on commerce and innovation, setting the stage for modern professional meetings.
        During the 19th century, industrialization spurred formal congresses like the Congress of Vienna (1815), emphasizing political and technical standardization across nations.
        The first conference dedicated solely to the World Wide Web, WWW1, took place at CERN from May 25–27, 1994, gathering 380 participants to discuss emerging hypertext standards; it is often called the "Woodstock of the Web".
        In the 21st century, large-scale tech events such as TED and Nvidia's GTC have expanded the boundaries of tech discourse, broadcasting ideas globally and influencing industry direction.

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        TechCon strives to advance the development and ethical application of emerging technologies by fostering open dialogue, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and lifelong learning among professionals.
        Inspired by organizations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which since 1947 has promoted professional standards and knowledge sharing in computing, TechCon's mission is to create an inclusive space where attendees can explore innovations ranging from AI and cybersecurity to quantum computing.
        Additionally, TechCon is committed to preserving tech's historical context—mirroring goals of the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT), founded in 1958 to study technology's societal impacts—by offering sessions that examine how past breakthroughs inform today's challenges.
