        Conferences as structured gatherings trace back to ancient Greece and Rome, where large public forums and religious pilgrimages served as early models of communal discourse :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. 
        By the 15th century, European trade fairs evolved into proto‐conferences focused on commerce and innovation, setting the stage for modern professional meetings :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}. 
        During the 19th century, industrialization spurred formal congresses like the Congress of Vienna (1815), emphasizing political and technical standardization across nations :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. 
        The first conference dedicated solely to the World Wide Web, WWW1, took place at CERN from May 25–27, 1994. It gathered 380 participants to discuss emerging hypertext standards and is often called the "Woodstock of the Web" :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. 
        In the 21st century, large‐scale tech events such as TED and Nvidia’s GTC have expanded the boundaries of tech discourse, broadcasting ideas globally and influencing industry direction :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.
